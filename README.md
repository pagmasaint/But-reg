# Butterfly recognition
This repository contains the code and resources for a **Butterfly Species Recognition** project. The model is trained to identify **75 different species of butterflies** from images. It leverages the power of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and the **InceptionV3** architecture, a state-of-the-art deep learning model known for its efficiency and accuracy in image recognition tasks
